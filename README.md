# Target-Polymath
What is this? Why is it being made? Why is it a GitHub Repo? This is the documentation behind Target: Polymath.

# What is this?
This is (the meta-documentation for) a series of projects I'll be making public as a sort of portfolio. 

# Why is it being made?
This project is 'sponsored' by two 'stakeholders' - a desire to gain a huge amount of knowledge, and a desire to use that knowledge to help others. I'm currently (2020 Aug) attending Western Governor's University, a wonderfully flexible and inexpensive college with a reasonable reputation and very few project-oriented deliverables. However, people with 'reasonable' reputations often aren't extended the longest levers with which to lift the heaviest weights; so, if I want to do the best work I can to improve the lives of others ('to lift the heaviest weights'), an excellent reputation and visible experience helps me get in the door.

Naturally, building a portfolio with 'reputation' as a stated goal can lead to a perverse incentive to lie or plagerize, to undertake particularly flamboyant or 'buzz-focused' or 'hyped' projects, or to chase after some kind of engagement metric. Pure words here can't disuade a critic from this opinion, so I trust in my actions - and transparent mistakes, as there will likely be plenty - to show that this is an honest record of honest effort.

# Why is it a GitHub Repo?
I'm using a GitHub Repo in what could be very very loosely described as a piece of media. I have a message I intend to convey (roughly, "Zach Allen is a skilled learner on his way to earning the adjective 'Polymath'"), and that message is fundamentally one of change. Marshall McCluhan famously argues that the medium is the message, and so I've chosen a GitHub Repo - which is a system of organized change - as the medium I'll use.

# How do I read this?
Generally, there's nothing wrong with just checking out the current state of different projects. However, the details of my process will stick around in commits and pull requests, so a little snooping is strongly encouraged. 

Currently (2020 Aug) I'll be largely following PMBOK and ITILv4 structures, partially to demonstrate my capabilities and partially to help keep myself organized and on track. Obviously those structures are a little wider than my scope and vision here, so some parts will be emulated (Customers, Demand) and some will be omitted (Service Desk, Service Continuity).

# Who are you?
Me? My name is Zach Allen. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which I'm expecting to earn in 2021 August. I have a particular interest in Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Algorithm Development. I'm incredibly lucky to be able to pick up skills quickly, and I intend to make use of that good fortune in the most beneficial way I possibly can.

# Finally, who am I?
Honestly I'd love to know that too. Say hi, leave a note.
